Wow so really Gosu expects me to implement my own GUI? After everything else?
I guess I need a Label class, for floating bits of text. They are given an anchor position and then can center draw or side midsection?
And then subclassed from anchor is button, which just adds a second image state and when you click on it it activates the second state.
Then we still need to figure out text boxes.
